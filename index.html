				<h2 class="ht3">Conduct bird census in urban areas</h2>
				<p class="p">The draft plan also drew attention towards the dwindling population of birds in urban
					areas. For
					instance, several species of birds such as the house sparrow, red-vented bulbul, crow, spotted
					owlet, etc. have shown a drastic decline in their populations due to increasing urbanisation in
					India.

					disperse up to 92 percent of all tree and woody species, including 85 timber species, 182 genera of
					edible plants (including spices), 153 medicinal plants, 146 ornamental plants, and 84 genera with
